 Our first assignment for MUSIC B30 was learning the basics for Logic Pro. The first portion of the lesson was navigating the controls. Once I got used to that I was able to start making music. Out of all the functions required for putting all of the tracks together, I thought the Pan/Balance knob was the coolest. This function allows the listener the hear the audio on different sides of the headphones. This ads depth and texture to the track.

The area shown above is the workspace where you drag tracks and move them to a specific measure. Having the measure number at the top was very helpful in organizing downbeats and cutoffs.

This area allowed me to look at the tracks individually and edit the volume via volume fader or pan knobs.

In the apple loops window is where you can search for loops to play in your workspace. This window also had a search bar and search specific preferences. This made it easy to find what I needed to complete the lesson. For example, if I wanted to include a piano loop in my track, I go to the top and click on piano to search only for piano tracks. To go even further, if I wanted a clean piano track, I can select my preferences to only search "clean piano tracks". This allowed me to save time when creating my mix.

### MY TIP 

TO SAVE TIME SET YOUR PREFERENCES BY INSTRUMENT AND GENRE TO SEARCH FOR LOOPS
