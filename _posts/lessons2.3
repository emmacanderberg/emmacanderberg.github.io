 This assignment presentation will go over lessons two and three. The mix I created in lesson one was used. In this assignment we focused on recording and editing audio. When I found out we were going to record audio to add to our mix, I knew excatly what I wanted to record. When I listen to music I like to listen for personal touches and natural sound like fingers hitting valves and breathing. In my recorded audio, I recorded myself walking with my keys. My lanyard has several keys attatched. When I walk with my keys it makes a relaxing jingling sound. When I got to the portion of the lesson where I had to comp several takes, I added finger snaps over the rain track to sound like heavy rain drops.

The area shown above is the tool menu. I used the fader tool to allow certain tracks to fade out where I wanted them to. I wanted the tracks to fade out to add depth and dynamic contrast. I also over lapped tracks to crossfade them together. I liked the over lapping lyrics. It made the track seem more distorted and interesting.

by pressing option-c I was allowed to label each track by color. This made it easier to organize my peoject.

In the channel strip I added different audio effects. For example space designer allowed me to add more reverb on my recorded audio.

### MY TIP 

If you only want to listen to one track, you can press the solo option(S) in the track header section. If you wanted to mute certain tracks, you would would press the mute option (M)
