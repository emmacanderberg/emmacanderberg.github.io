 Our first assignment for MUSIC B30 was learning the basics for Logic Pro. The first portion of the lesson was navigating the controls. Once I got used to that I was able to start making music. Out of all the functions required for putting all of the tracks together, I thought the Pan/Balance knob was the coolest. This function allows the listener the hear the audio on different sides of the headphones. This ads depth and texture to the track.
