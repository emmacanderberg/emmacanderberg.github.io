      Alright, so these lessons were for sure contained the MOST information, but my heart broke a little each time it said "you dont need to save this" eventually I got so frustrted that I saved them all out of spite toward the author. 
      One of my favorite parts of these lessons was working with the piano and trying out different software instruments. When it had us play around with the MIDI region, I kind of went out of control with merging recordings because I wanted so many layers. One of my favorite features was the quantize option. (if only this worked with live playing) 
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      ##MY TIP 
      to have a more comfortable view of your work station and the piano roll region, click the icon show and it will snap automatically into a more comfortable position.
