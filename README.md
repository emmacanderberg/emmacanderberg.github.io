These three lessons for sure took a toll on me. These took the most amount of work. I did learn the most information from them though. Personally these were the lessons I felt most comfortable using Logic X Pro.

In these lessons I learned how to remove background noise between performances on a track. I also learned how to drag a region while ensuring that it remains its position relative to the bar lines.

Another skill I leanred when editing the raise it up track was how to cover up clicking sounds when you adjust time. All you have to do is use the fade out tool at the end of each section there is a click you hear.

One thing I found really interesting was the ability to adjust the pitch of audio. While I was messing around in the piano roll I found I was able to use on any thing I used in there. 

# MY TIP: this tip does not really refer to a specific function on Logic, but I think it is helpful. When you are listening for an error, but you can't quite put your finger on what it is, take a break. For example get some water or walk around. Going back to something a couple minutes later with a freshened mind can really up your hearing ability to point out and correct an error in your song. 

final thoughts: Im so happy I took this class. I am greatful to have worked with Mr.D and thankful for all his help and insight. I have learned so much and had made my music knowledge grow in so many ways. I love learning new things about music and this class topped all of the music education classes I have taken. I am proud to say that I can comfortable use Logic X Pro. I am hoping to eventually use and grow these skill to do sound work for Golden Empire Drum and Bugle Corps in the future.
