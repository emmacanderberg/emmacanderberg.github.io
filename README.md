      Alright, so these lessons were for sure contained the MOST information, but my heart broke a little each time it said "you dont need to save this" eventually I got so frustrted that I saved them all out of spite toward the author. 
      One of my favorite parts of these lessons was working with the piano and trying out different software instruments. When it had us play around with the MIDI region, I kind of went out of control with merging recordings because I wanted so many layers. One of my favorite features was the quantize option. (if only this worked with live playing)

      I also learned how to use the MIDI as a drumset and experiment with different beats and how to create and resize different notes with the bassline. ( mine was inspired by Seinfeld )
