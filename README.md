##### [deedledootLISTEN](audio/deedledoot.mp3)  right here is my new piano track while messing around with the piano roll, it felt wrong not having atleast ONE audio portion of the presentation ( i took out skyline piano )

  Alright, so these lessons were for sure contained the MOST information, but my heart broke a little each time it said "you dont need to save this" eventually I got so frustrted that I saved them all out of spite toward the author. 
      One of my favorite parts of these lessons was working with the piano and trying out different software instruments. When it had us play around with the MIDI region, I kind of went out of control with merging recordings because I wanted so many layers. One of my favorite features was the quantize option. (if only this worked with live playing) 
 
 
     
   I also learned how to use the MIDI as a drumset and experiment with different beats and how to create and resize different notes with the bassline. ( mine was inspired by Seinfeld ) using the pencil tool allowed me to lengthen notes. Changing the velocity let certain notes come out more. ( the colored regions)

When learning how to combine two software instruments into one patch, I really took advantage of the key limit feature. This allowed me to set my personal liking for octaves.

another skill I learned which will come in very handy and save me a lot of time was the note repeat and spot earase feature

#### MY TIP
      
   to have a more comfortable view of your work station and the piano roll region, click the icon show and it will snap automatically into a more comfortable position.
