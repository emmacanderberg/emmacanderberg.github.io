 Our first assignment for MUSIC B30 was learning the basics for Logic Pro. The first portion of the lesson was navigating the controls. Once I got used to that I was able to start making music. Out of all the functions required for putting all of the tracks together, I thought the Pan/Balance knob was the coolest. This function allows the listener the hear the audio on different sides of the headphones. This ads depth and texture to the track.

The area shown above is the workspace where you drag tracks and move them to a specific measure. Having the measure number at the top was very helpful in orgsnizing downbeats and cutoffs.
