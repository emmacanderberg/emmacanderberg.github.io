 This assignment presentation will go over lessons two and three. The mix I created in lesson one was used. In this assignment we focused on recording and editing audio. When I found out we were going to record audio to add to our mix, I knew excatly what I wanted to record. When I listen to music I like to listen for personal touches and natural sound like fingers hitting valves and breathing. In my recorded audio, I recorded myself walking with my keys. My lanyard has several keys attatched. When I walk with my keys it makes a relaxing jingling sound. When I got to the portion of the lesson where I had to comp several takes, I added finger snaps over the rain track to sound like heavy rain drops.

The area shown above is the tool menu. I used the fader tool to allow certain tracks to fade out where I wanted them to. I wanted the tracks to fade out to add depth and dynamic contrast. I also over lapped tracks to crossfade them together. I liked the over lapping lyrics. It made the track seem more distorted and interesting.

This area allowed me to look at the tracks individually and edit the volume via volume fader or pan knobs.

In the apple loops window is where you can search for loops to play in your workspace. This window also had a search bar and search specific preferences. This made it easy to find what I needed to complete the lesson. For example, if I wanted to include a piano loop in my track, I go to the top and click on piano to search only for piano tracks. To go even further, if I wanted a clean piano track, I can select my preferences to only search "clean piano tracks". This allowed me to save time when creating my mix.

### MY TIP 

TO SAVE TIME SET YOUR PREFERENCES BY INSTRUMENT AND GENRE TO SEARCH FOR LOOPS
